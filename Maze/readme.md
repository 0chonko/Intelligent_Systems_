# Module 6 Intelligent Systems Project

This project consists in applying the knowledge in AI algorithms by combining two or more intelligent features. 
The program combines A-start search algorithm and object recognition (and classification) thhrough computer vision.
The purpose of the project is two prototype a **visual synthesizer** that generates sounds on a small
analog circuit based on obstacles (shapes) shown in the visual field. The search algorithm is, then, the source of 
modulation of sound. This modulation is influenced by the length of the detected path (and potentially other features 
not developed by the end of the project, i.e. number of turns, direction, etc..).
